Once upon a time, there was a kind girl named Cinderella.
She lived with her wicked stepmother and stepsisters, who treated her poorly.
One day, an invitation to the royal ball arrived.
With the help of her fairy godmother, Cinderella attended the ball.
She met the prince, but had to leave at midnight, losing her glass slipper.
The prince searched the kingdom to find her.
When he did, they lived happily ever after.
