Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Snow White.
Her stepmother, the queen, was jealous of her beauty.
The queen ordered a huntsman to kill Snow White, but he let her go.
Snow White found refuge with seven dwarfs in the forest.
The queen, disguised as an old woman, gave her a poisoned apple.
Snow White fell into a deep sleep until a prince woke her with a kiss.
They lived happily ever after.
